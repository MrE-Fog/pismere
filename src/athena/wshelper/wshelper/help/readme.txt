About the Help Source Files:
---------------------------

autoduck.fmt
html.fmt
contents.d

These files correspond to Autoduck 2.0.96.0406, which is the latest
version I saw at ftp://ftp.accessone.com/pub/ericartzt/ (which is
probably supposed to be 2.0.97.0406 -- I think the new versioning
scheme is date-based.)


autoduck.fmt
html.fmt

The only changes in them from the versions disstributed with the
Autoduck distribution is !P -> !p so that filepaths are listed in
their default case rather than being forced to uppercase.


contents.d

This file has the table of contents (TOC) for the wshelper
documentation.
