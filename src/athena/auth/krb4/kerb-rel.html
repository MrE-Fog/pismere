<h2>What's New</h2>


<h3>03/04/98</h3>

<ol>

<p>
<li>
Only Win32 support.  Yay!  This has been tested on i386.  Alpha has
not been reccently tested, but it should work.

<p>
<li>
Easier make procedure using MSVC++ 4.x (well, 6.0 works for
sure...)

<p>
<li>
Leash does not live here right now.

</ol>

<h3>Previously</h3>

<ol>

<p>
<li>
integration of Kclient into the source release. Cornell provided this
work. We made a small modification ot IsCredExpired (see
below). Cornell has wrapped the krbv4w32 functions with MUTEXES so the
code should be thread safe.

<p>
<li>
32-bit support, (tested i386, Alpha so far) Can anybody compile
this for MIPS and PowerPC and provide us with binaries or necessary
source patches?

<p>
<li>
Modification of the credential cache:
<P>
We encountered a problem at MIT that we felt needed to be addressed
even though it broke some backwards compatibility. We found that if
someone used a Kerberized application spanning multiple PPP sessions a
Kerberos error would be generated and few applications would catch
this error and try to get new tickets instead.  E.g. Suppose a user
starts a PPP connection and then starts Eudora, fetching mail. The
user then decides to close down the PPP connection while they read
their mail and compose responses. Next they initiate a new PPP
connection and incorporate mail again. Note that the user never exited
Eudora. Instead of prompting the user for their name and password
Eudora will generate and error message. The only way for the user to
recover the functionality would be to use Leash, Kview, or kdestroy to
destroy their old tickets so that Eudora would get new tickets.
<P>
This happened because many ISPs hand out a new IP address to a user
each time that user reconnects to the system. Also a Kerberos ticket
includes the machines local IP address in an encrypted form this is
used by most severs to insure that the ticket has not been copied to
another users machine.
<P>
Since the local IP address is stored in the ticket it seems that it
should be easy to compare this data to the machine's local IP address
at the same time that an application is checking to see if the ticket
has expired. Unfortunately the IP address in the ticket is encrypted
in the server's session key and so is inaccessible to the local
machine.
<P>
Instead we borrowed an idea from Kerberos version 5 and decided to
store the local IP address, unencrypted, in the credential which is
cached in the local cache. Within the Kclient function IsCredExpired
or the krbv4wxx function kchktkt we verify that the ticket has not
expired and that the local IP address matches the IP address stored in
the ticket.
<P>
This implies that machines with multiple copies of kclnt32.dll or
krbv4w32.dll, of different versions, may encounter unexpected errors
when using Kerberized applications. The normal error message generated
will be BAD_TKT_FILE_FORMAT or NO_TKT_FILE.
<P>
Users of applications that use other vendors Kerberos implementations
may also be affected. E.g. some software from FTP, Inc.

<p>
<li>
Add a new function to Kclient DLL. This function is
SendTicketsForService(). It is basically a send_auth type
function. Before everyone complains please read the following
explanation.
<P>
Qualcomm has been working with Platinum on a 32-bit Kclient which
would supports both Kerberos v4 and v5. From what I have heard this is
a commercial implementation. It ignores GSS or other abstraction
layers above the Kerberos layer that application developers should
write to. It keeps its ticket cache in the DLL, as such it will not
share the ticket cache with other Kerberos implementations that may
reside on the user's system.
<P>
Platinum and Qualcomm decide to add a new API call to the Kclient
interface. Eudora uses this new function if it finds a KCLNT32.DLL. In
this case it does not use the thunking application KERB16.
<P>
We have duplicated this function in our release of KCLNT32 so that
Eudora will not GPF. Please DO NOT WRITE APPLICATIONS TO THIS
FUNCTION.

<p>
<li>
We stole an idea from Cornell. If the clock is out of synch when we
are trying to obtain a ticket we resynch the clock and try again. We
inform the user if this occured.

<p>
<li>
Fixed up some problems relating to DLL initialization. WSAStartup
will be called if necessary by a few functions. This was needed to
handle some differences in DLL initialization under Win32 when
multiple applications were using the DLL at the same time. Also fixed
up some initialization of the com_err functions due to similar issues.

<p>
<li>
Added two new functions to leashw32.dll,
Leash_set_help_file(char*szHelpFile) which allows an application
developer to specify which help file to use from the Dialogbox
presented when using the Leash_kinit function. If the argument is NULL
the function will check the environment variable KERB_HELP. If this is
not set the hard coded value of kerberos.hlp will be used.
<P>
The other function is Leash_get_help_file which allows an application
developer to determine what the name of the help file being used is.
<P>
These are defined in lshfunc.c

<p>
<li>
Broke the OS/2 support. Does anyone care?

<p>
<li>
The krbconf.c file was extensively modified. This is one of the
places we broke OS/2 support. The libaries still rely on the krb.con
and krbrealm.con files however the location is now much more
flexible. Here is the order of searching where $(foo) is the value of
the environment variable:

<ul>
<li>$(NDIR)\kerb\
<li>The current directory
<li>The Windows directory
<li>The Windows system directory
<li>The directory containing the executable file for the current task
<li>The directories in the path
<li>The list of directories mapped in a network
<li>$(NDIR)\
<li>$(ETC)\
</ul>

<p>
<li>
The 32-bit libraries are linked with libcmt instead of libc.

<p>
<li>
Added to the export section of the def files:

<ul>
<li>krb_set_tkt_string
<li>krb_get_in_tkt
<li>des_pcbc_encrypt
<li>LocalHostAddr
<li>krb_get_krbhst
<li>krb_get_tf_fullname
</ul>

<p>
<li>
The optimization flags for the NODEBUG build have been
changed. /Ox broke things. We took a more conervative approach. No
problems noticed so far.

<p>
<li>
Modified Kclient to NOT use x_htons. Kclient now requires
winsock. This allows us to build kclient for the Alpha, and
theoretically other NT hardware platforms.

<p>
<li>
Fix the send_auth so that we do not fail on a null realm. Also
detects when an invalid socket descriptor has been passed (special
thanks to Eudora 3.0 for providing a test case.)

</ol>

<a name="support"></a>
<h2>Supported Platforms</h2>

<P>
This release of Kerberos v4 is for Win32 platforms only.  These
include Windows NT and Windows 9x.  We have only built is on x86, but
it should work on other CPUs as well.

<P>
The libraries provided for Win32 support are:
<P>
krbv4w32.dll, kclnt32.dll - (win32) (tested on x86 only)

<P>
The applications provided are:
<P>
kview32.exe, kinit.exe, kdestroy.exe, klist.exe, kexpire.exe

<P>
Leash is no longer included in this distribution.  It has been pulled
out as a separate component while it is being rewritten.  This new
version will enable users to obtain version 4 and version 5 tickets
through a single username/password dialog.

<a name="config_bin"></a>
<h3>Binaries</h3>

<P>
The DLLs <code>krbv4w32.dll</code> and <code>kclnt32.dll</code> should
be in your path.
<P>
At MIT we normally recommend to users that they have a directory
<code>c:\net\mit</code> on their path and that the files reside in
this directory. Many other sites recommend that users place these
files in their Windows system directory or the Windows directory. MIT
prefers to avoid this for a few reasons.
<P>
For MIT users we prefer using <code>\net\mit</code> for a few
reasons. First this directory historically exists on most of our
users' systems. It is also where we normally recommend installing
locally developed applications. By using this setup we are able to
support users that insist on running multiple operating systems or
multiple versions of an operating system on their machine. It is much
easier to track down a single copy of a DLL and determine its version
number. Also the number of files in this directory is much smaller
than in the OS directory so it is much easier for users to locate and
determine the version number if this becomes necessary. Finally, very
few third party installers will attempt to modify the
<code>\net\mit</code> directory so we don't worry about what another
application will do to our binaries.
<P>
The disadvantages to seperating the DLLs from the OS are that users
must add yet another directory to their path. And when they do this
manually they may make a typing mistake. Sometimes the typing mistakes
can be subtle and difficult to resolve. E.g <code>c:\net\mit</code> is
not the same as <code>c\net\mit</code>.
<P>
If users like to invoke the applications from a command line instead
of just the GUI the applications should also be on the path. Again at
MIT we normally install <code>kview32.exe</code>,
<code>kinit.exe</code>, <code>kdestroy.exe</code>, and
<code>klist.exe</code> in <code>\net\mit</code>.
<P>

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<hr>
<a name="config_services"></a>
<h3>Services File</h3>

<P>
The Kerberos DLLs need to know what port to talk to the Kerberos
server on. They obtain this information from the local services
file. In many cases you may to add a line to the services file
especially if the vendor did not provide this in the default services
file.
<P>
If the information is absent from the local services file you will
normally get a "Can't send request (send to kdc)" error.
<P>
Usually the line that will need adding is:
<P>
<pre>
kerberos 750/udp kdc #kerberos UDP
</pre>
<P>
In the case of Microsoft NT the default services file normally
contains this already. This file is usually located in
<code>\winnt\system32\drivers\etc</code>.
<P>
For other stacks you should consult the vendor documentation or just
search your local hard disk for a file named services.

<p>
Note: It seems that the "kerberos-master 751/tcp" line in the
services file is obsolete and not required.


<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<hr>
<a name="config_conf"></a>
<h3>Kerberos Configuration Files (krb.con/krbrealm.con)</h3>

<P>
The Kerberos DLLs normally need two configuration files to function
properly. These are krb.con and krbrealm.con. Older releases had
overly restrictive locations for these files. Previously the files had
to be located in <code>c:\net\kerb</code> or <code>%NDIR%\kerb</code>
where <code>%NDIR%</code> was an environment variable e.g. <code>set
NDIR=d:\etc</code> and the files should be located in
<code>d:\etc\kerb\</code>
<P>
At the suggestion of several sites we relaxed this restriction. The
DLLs will now search for the <code>krb.con</code> and
<code>krbrealm.con</code> in the following locations and search oder:

<ol>
<li> %NDIR%\kerb\
<li> The current directory
<li> The Windows directory
<li> The Windows system directory
<li> The directory containing the executable file for the current task
<li> The directories in the path
<li> The list of directories mapped in a network
<li>%NDIR%\
<li>%ETC%\
</ol>
<P>
Note: <code>%NDIR%</code> and <code>%ETC%</code> indicate the
expansion of the environment variables named <code>NDIR</code> and
<code>ETC</code>, if present.
<P>
It is up the local system administrator or end user to configure the
machine for reasonable performance.

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<hr>
<a name="config_conf_mod"></a>
<h3>Modifying Kerberos Configuration Files (krb.con/krbrealm.con)</h3>

<P>
It is anticipated that most sites using Kerberos version 4 on Windows
will also have an existing UNIX Kerberos infrastrucutre. For that
reason we kept the format of the <code>krb.con</code> indetical to the
UNIX <code>krb.conf</code>and the format of <code>krbrealm.con</code>
identical to the UNIX <code>krb.realms</code>. For many users the
easiest way to configure these files for use at their local site will
be to simply ftp the corresponding files from a local UNIX machine
that is already properly configured.

<P>
The <code>krb.con</code> file contain configuration information describing
the Kerberos realm and the Kerberos key distribution center (KDC)
servers for known realms.

<P>
<code>krb.con</code> contains the name of the local realm in the first
line, followed by lines indicating realm/host entries. The first token
is a realm name, and the second is a hostname of a host running a KDC
for that realm. The words "admin server" following the hostname
indicate that the host also provides an administrative database server
which is contacted when changing a user's password. For example:

<PRE>
ATHENA.MIT.EDU
ATHENA.MIT.EDU kerberos.mit.edu admin server
ATHENA.MIT.EDU kerberos-1.mit.edu
ATHENA.MIT.EDU kerberos-2.mit.edu
LCS.MIT.EDU kerberos.lcs.mit.edu admin server
</PRE>

<P>
If this was your <code>krb.con</code> file and you wanted to change
the default local realm to <code>CIT.CORNELL.EDU</code> you would edit
it to look like:

<PRE>
CIT.CORNELL.EDU
CIT.CORNELL.EDU kerberos.cit.cornell.edu admin server
ATHENA.MIT.EDU kerberos.mit.edu admin server
ATHENA.MIT.EDU kerberos-1.mit.edu
ATHENA.MIT.EDU kerberos-2.mit.edu
LCS.MIT.EDU kerberos.lcs.mit.edu admin server
</PRE>

<P>
The <code>krbrealm.con</code> file is the host to Kerberos realm
translation file. This provides a translation from a local hostname to
the Kerberos realmname for the services provided by that host.
<P>
Each line of the translation file is in one the following forms
(domain_name should be of the form <code>.XXX.YYY</code>,
e.g. <code>.LCS.MIT.EDU</code>):

<PRE>
	host_name kerberos_realm
	domain_name kerberos_realm
</PRE>

<P>
If a hostname exactly matches the host_name field in a line of the
first form, the corresponding realm is the realm of the host. If a
hostname does not match any host_name in the file, but its domain
exactly matches the domain_name field in a line of the second form,
the corresponding realm is the realm of the host.
<P>
If no translation entry applies, the host's realm is considered to be
the hostname's domain portion converted to uppercase.

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<hr>
<a name="config_cache"></a>
<h3>Ticket Cache</h3>

<P>
At this time users must store their tickets on the disk. We hope to
change this in the near future.

<P>
If you are an NT user concerned about security use the NTFS file
system and store the tickets in a directory that is writeable and
readable by you but no one else. This directory should not be
shareable. <i>Nor should it be on a remote machine.</i>

<P>
You can specify the name of the ticket file and the directory in which
it is stored via the environment variable <code>KRBTKFILE</code>. For
example, to store your tickets in a file called <code>tkt-joe.krb</code> in
the directory <code>c:\users\joe-user</code>, use the follwing statement:

<pre>
set KRBTKFILE=c:\users\joe-user\tkt-joe.krb
</pre>

If the environment variable <code>KRBTKFILE</code> is not used, the
default value <code>%TEMP%\ticket.krb</code> will be used.  That is,
tickets will be stored in the file <code>ticket.krb</code> in
<code>%TEMP%</code>. If you do not have an environment variable named
<code>TEMP</code> the environment variables <code>TMP</code> and
<code>HOME</code> will also be checked and used if present.  As a last
resort the hard coded path <code>c:\tmp\ticket.ktb</code> will be
used. Whichever method is used you'll have to <b>make sure the
directory exists</b>, or Windows Kerberos will report an error.

<P>
[<i>note: which applications produce what error mesage under this
condition?</i>]

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<hr>
<a name="config_time"></a>
<h3>Date and Time issues</h3>

<P>
<i>Why Kerberos cares what time it is...</i>

<P>Kerberos authentication uses time stamps as part of its
protocol. When the clocks of the Kerberos server and your computer are
too far out of synchronization, you cannot authenticate properly. Both
the Kerberos server and the Kerberos client depend on having clocks
that are synchronized within a certain margin. This margin is normally
5 minutes.
<P>
The Date and Time on the machine running Microsoft Windows will need
to be &quot;accurately&quot; set.  If the date or time is off
&quot;too far&quot;, Kerberos authentication will not work.
<P>
In this release if a clock skew error is detected the libraries will
attempt to resynchronze the clock to the network time automatically
one time. The user will be warned that this has occured. If this fails
or if a clock skew is detected again later the user will have to
manually resynchronize the machine time to the Kerberos server's
time. The Leash application provides a buton which will attempt to
resynchronize the clock.
<P>
By default the server that the libraries will contact when
synchronizing the time is "TIME". The domain name has been left off on
purpose. If local system administrators create a machine with a CNAME
of time within the local domain the clients will contact this machine
by default.
<P>
If you local system administrators are opposed to doing this for some
reason people can edit the resource <code>LSH_TIME_HOST</code> in the
<code>leashw32.dll</code> to the name appropriate for their local
site. You can also edit the header files from the source distribution
and recompile for your local site. However, this is not recommended.
<P>
You can also avoid this problem by running a local, properly
configured, NTP program on your machine.

<h2>Browsing the Source Tree</h2>

<p>
Here is the layout of the MIT Kerberos v4 for Win32 source tree.

|       +---krbdll	The Kerberos portion of krbv4wXX.dll
\---kview		The source for Cornell's Kview.exe and Kview32.exe

</PRE>

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<hr>
<a name="build"></a>
<h2>Building the Source Tree</h2>

<p>
We use Microsoft Visual C++ to build the source tree.  Your mileage
with other compilers may vary.

<ol>

<li>Unzip the source distribution with the -d option so that the
directory structure is preserved.

<li>Optionally define the build environment

<li>Type <code>nmake</code> (with the appropriate options if step 2 is
skipped)

</ol>

<p>
The toplevel make file requires a few environment variables to be
defined.  These can be defined before invoking nmake or they can be
specified as arguments to <code>nmake</code>.  If you invoke <i>nmake</i>
without defining these varibles, you will get an error message
describing what you need to define.

<p>
The variable below are the only ones that you should have to define:

<PRE>
NODEBUG=		#if undefined, will create debug binaries
			#setting it will yield symbol free binaries
KRBV4_PATH=c:\src\krb4	#the path where this makefile resides 
VC32_DIR=c:\msdev	#the toplevel path of your 32-bit compiler 
</PRE>

<p>
To set these variables at the <code>nmake</code> command-line.  Here
are some examples:

<PRE>
<i>For a debug Win32 i386 build:</i>
	nmake KRBV4_PATH=c:\src\krb4 VC32_DIR=c:\msdev 

<i>For a symbol free (nodebug) Win32 i386 build: </i>
	nmake KRBV4_PATH=c:\src\krb4 VC32_DIR=c:\msdev NODEBUG=1
</PRE>

<p>
There are several flags that get set in the make files. By default we
build with -DAFS so that the both MIT and Transarc AFS style string to
key algorithms will be tried when authenticating.

<p>
We need to document other aspects of the make files, any volunteers?

<p>
The make files will create logs of the build in makwin32.log.  Look
there if something fails.

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<hr>
<a name="todo"></a>
<h2>To Do</h2>

<ol>

<p>
<li>
In memory ticket cache on NT

<p>
<li>
Installer

<p>
<li>
com_err rewrite and well documented way for applications to control
error reporting to the end user. Cornell went to a lot of effort to
overcome out limitations.

<p>
<li>
Re-implementation of displaying debug messages without using a message
box. The intention is to provide similiar functionality to debugwin
without having to distribute debugwin to end users.

<p>
<li>
Rewrite of Leash to support v4 and v5 as well as having many
improvements in the user interface.

<p>
<li>
People have suggested that we use the registry more. 

<p>
<li>
At this time I am delaying that. First I want to know how MS is going
to use the resgistry for Kerberos v5 in NT 5.0. I am also in an
environment where we are support win16 apps running on win32 and
win16. Given the issues that this would involve us in I prefer to punt
for now. I agree that Kerberos v5 needs to address this issue. I am
not sure that v4 warrents this work at this late date.

<p>
<li>
Other complaints:

<ol type=a>

<p>
<li>
Apps that require extra environment variables to be set
<P>
We no longer require environment variables but will use them to modify
the behavior of searching for the krb.con and krbrealm.con files
(NDIR). KRBTKFILE can be used to modify the location and name of the
ticket cache when in memory tickets are not being used. KERB_HELP can
be set to specify the name of the Kerberos help file.

<p>
<li>
Apps that require additions to the PATH variable
<P>
Similar to the above explanation. Modifications to the path are not
required but at MIT we prefer to put locally developed DLLs and EXEs
in \net\mit and then add this to the path. This makes it easier to
support users that run multiple versions of Windows on the same
machine. It also allows us to survive OS re-installs. It is also
helpful to users that like to start applications from the command
line.

<p>
<li>
Apps that require root level directories to be created
<P>
I am not aware that we ever required this. If someone thought we did
it was probably due to poor documentation of the configuration
options.

<p>
<li>
Apps that install lots of stuff to the windows directory

<P>
We have always avoided this. I do not understand why this complaint
was raised against the Kerberos implementation.

<p>
<li>
Apps that don't query the user before overwriting files

<P>
Installer issue. We haven't yet released an installer.

<p>
<li>
Apps that don't have a full uninstaller (which includes removing
registry entries and removing the installation directory once its
