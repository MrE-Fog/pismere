			    krbcc32 Notes
			    -------------

For architectural and implementation information, see "krbcc32
Architecture" and "krbcc32 Implementation" in architecture.txt and
implementation.txt, respectively.

Build Options:
-------------

You can rebuild src/lib/memory.cxx with DEBUG_MEMORY=1 to enable debug
output for memory allocations.  The default is to have that off for
both builds since that generates a lot of debug output.

On VC++, C++, standards:
-----------------------

It turns out that you cannot output to cerr while the CRT is
initializing.  Therefore, make sure your new operator does not try to
output to cerr during the init process.  Using printf seems ok,
however.
