<p class="MsoNormal">The Leash Properties dialog, located on the
Options menu,
allows you to configure operational properties specific to the Leash
application which are not accessible directly via the Options menu.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Here you can set a time server from which Leash
will obtain
the correct time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Leash needs the
correct time because of the time dependencies in Kerberos tickets.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>When you specify a time server, Leash tries
to get the time from that server when you next run the Synchronize Time
command.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The default value for the time
server is "time".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If access to
a time server were to fail, Leash would notify you, and revert to the
server
"time".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whichever server
succeeds, Leash would tell you where it found the time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>See the Synchronize Time command for more
information.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Kerberos libraries depend on configuration
files for
their proper operation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <b>Create
Missing Configuration Files</b> is checked, Leash will construct
replacements
for missing configuration files upon startup.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is performed by extracting Kerberos configuration
information from
the local Windows registry and the Domain Name System.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The contents of the created file may then be
edited using the <b>Kerberos Properties Dialog</b>.<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When <b>Request Kerberos 4 credentials</b> is
checked, Leash
will attempt to retrieve Kerberos 4 credentials when ticket
initialization,
renewal, or importation is performed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Leash will attempt a Kerberos 5 to Kerberos 4 conversion and if
that
fails an initial Kerberos 4 ticket request will be generated.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Kerberos realms are increasingly configured
to support on Kerberos 5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the realms
you use do not support Kerberos 4 it is suggested that this button be
unchecked.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The <b>Restore Leash Defaults</b> button is used
to restore
user configurable Leash settings to the defaults as configured either
by the
local machine system administrator or by the Kerberos for Windows
distribution.<br>
