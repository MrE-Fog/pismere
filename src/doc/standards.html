<h2>Introducton</h2>
</a>

<p>
We want all of our code to have a consistent coding style.  For code
that comes from third parties, we will generally maintain the original
style of that code.


<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<hr>
<a name="format">
<h2>Formatting Your Source Code</h2>
</a>

<p>
If possible, try to have no source code lines longer than 79
characters.  Do not store tabs in a line after any non-tab character.
Tab stops must be set to 8 characters in your editor.  That should be
independent from the indentation setting.  The indentation setting
should be 4 characters.

<p><font color="#FF0000">
<strong>QUESTION:</strong> Do we want to outlaw tabs altogether?
</font>

<h3>Putting Visual Studio 6.0 to Work for You</h3>

<p>
You can use <a href="site/reg/user/msdev-editor.reg">this registry
file</a> to set up Visual Studio 6.0 to have the proper tabbing
defaults.

<h3>Putting Emacs to Work for You</h3>

<p>
You can use Emacs to help you format your source code.  First, you add
the emacs locker by running <code>\\fqd.isnt.mit.edu\locker\addlocker
emacs</code> from a prompt.  Then, from that prompt, start up Emacs
with the command-line: <code>runemacs.cmd</code> (the <em>.cmd</em> is
important).

<p>
You can then hit TAB to indent the current line or select an entire
region (like, say, the entire buffer) and do <code>M-x
indent-region</code>.  You can also do <code>M-x
pismre-remove-ws</code> to remove trailing whitespace from your files.

<h3>Back to Formatting</h3>

<p>It is important to put the open-brace that starts the body of a C
function in column zero, and avoid putting any other open-brace or
open-parenthesis or open-bracket in column zero.  Several tools look
for open-braces in column zero to find the beginnings of C functions.
These tools will not work on code not formatted that way.

<p>It is also important for function definitions to start the name of
the function in column zero.  This helps people to search for function
definitions, and may also help certain tools recognize them.

<p>So as to make it easy to read, parse, and modify argument lists, we
list the arguments one per line, indented at 4 characters.  This makes
it so that we don't have to worry about splitting arguments, etc.
Thus, the proper format is this:

<blockquote>
<pre>
static char *
concat(
    char *s1,
    char *s2
    )
{
    ...
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Put a comment explaining the function before the function definition.
The format is decribed in the <a href="#comments">Commenting Your
Work</a>.

<p>
Write prototypes for all of your functions.  Include argument names in
your prototypes, to help the reader understand what they mean.  Use
the formatting described above.  You should simply be able to copy the
function header as the prototype.  Leave the variable names in the
prototype so as to make the prototypes more self-documenting (and to
make it so you can just simply copy-paste when updating them).

<p>
When declaring local variables, only declare one variable per line.
This makes teh code easier to read.

<p>For the body of the function, we prefer code formatted like this:

<blockquote>
<pre>
    if (x < foo(y, z))
    {
        haha = bar[4] + 5;
    }
    else
    {
        while (z)
        {
            haha += foo(z, z);
            z--;
        }
        return ++x + bar();
    }
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>In an if-else clause, we always put the enclosing curly braces to
reduce the possibility of error and to make the code easier to read.
On a singleton if statement, the curly braces are optional.

<p>We find it easier to read a program when it has spaces before the
open parenthesis and after the commas.  Especially after the commas. 
<i>However, when making a function call, do not put a space before the
open parenthesis.  Do put spaces before the open parenthesis after
"while", "if", or "for", though.</i>

<p>When you split an expression into multiple lines, split it after an
operator, not after one.  Also include extra ()s to make the operator
precedence more explicit.  This helps make the code easier to read.
Here is the right way:

<blockquote>
<pre>
    if (foo_this_is_long && and_so_is_this_variable && (bar > win(x, y, z)) &&
        remaining_condition)
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Try to avoid having two operators of different precedence at the same
level of indentation.  For example, don't write this:

<blockquote>
<pre>
    mode = (inmode[j] == VOIDmode ||
            GET_MODE_SIZE(outmode[j]) > GET_MODE_SIZE(inmode[j]) ?
            outmode[j] : inmode[j]);
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Instead, use extra parentheses so that the indentation shows the
nesting:

<blockquote>
<pre>
    mode = ((inmode[j] == VOIDmode) ||
            (GET_MODE_SIZE(outmode[j]) > GET_MODE_SIZE(inmode[j]))) ?
            outmode[j] : inmode[j]);
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Insert extra parentheses so that Emacs will indent the code properly.
For example, the following indentation looks nice if you do it by hand,
but Emacs would mess it up:

<blockquote>
<pre>
    v = rup->ru_utime.tv_sec*1000 + rup->ru_utime.tv_usec/1000 +
        rup->ru_stime.tv_sec*1000 + rup->ru_stime.tv_usec/1000;
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
But adding a set of parentheses solves the problem:

<blockquote>
<pre>
    v = (rup->ru_utime.tv_sec*1000 + rup->ru_utime.tv_usec/1000 +
         rup->ru_stime.tv_sec*1000 + rup->ru_stime.tv_usec/1000);
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
   Format do-while statements like this:

<blockquote>
<pre>
    do
    {
        a = foo(a);
    }
    while (a > 0);
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
When writing return statements, do not put parentheses around the
return value; just write "return foo;".

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<hr>
<a name="headers">
<h2>Header Files</h2>
</a>

<p>Each header file should check for and define a unique symbol to
prevent it from being included multiple times during compilation.
For example:

<blockquote>
<pre>
#ifndef __NameOfHeaderFile_ExtensionOfHeaderFile__
#define __NameOfHeaderFile_ExtensionOfHeaderFile__
...
#endif /* __NameOfHeaderFile_ExtensionOfHeaderFile__ */
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
If your header file name is not particularly unique, you can prefix
it with the name of the compoment to which it belongs.  Or you might
add some unique string to the end.

<h2>Using the C Pre-Processor</h2>
</a>

<H3>Macros</H3>
<p>
When defining macros, use all-caps names.  If you cannot do that for
some reason, append _macro at the end of the macro.  This will help
people debugging your code to identify what are macros and what are
real symbols.

<P>PWhen writing a multi-line macro, please use the following
convention:

<OL>
<LI>In general, a macro should be one of the following:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
a) a declaration macro (used in type of variable declarations)
<BR>b) a data structure builder macro (to be used in an initializer)
<BR>c) an expression
<BR>d) a single statement
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<LI>A macro should NOT terminate in a semicolon.
<P>

<LI>If you have a macro that looks like a block, you can convert it
into a single C statement by enclosing the block with a do/while(0):

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
#define SWAP(a, b, t) { (t) = (a); (a) = (b); (b) = (t); }
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</PRE>

<BR>would then become:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
#define SWAP(a, b, t) do { (t) = (a); (a) = (b); (b) = (t); } while(0)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</PRE>

The reason to convert a block into a single statement is so that
someone can write code that uses the macro as though it were a
function returning void:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
if (...)
    SWAP(...);
else
    SWAP(...);
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</PRE>

If the SWAP() macro were not enclosed in do/while(0), the above code
would be an error.
<P>

<LI>In general, a source code macro should be as readable as the
corresponding source code (according to our coding standards).  This
means that you will need to break up multi-statement macros into
multiple lines.  To do line continuations, use a backslash at the end
of each line.  Line up all the backslashes in the same column.  Using
the above SWAP() macro as an example:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
#define SWAP(a, b, t) \
   do {               \
       (temp) = (a);  \
       (a) = (b);     \
       (b) = (temp);  \
   } while(0)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</PRE>
</OL>

<p>
Make sure you comment any pre-processor symbols or macros that you
define.

<H3>Defines</H3>
<p>
Never put an <code>#ifdef</code> around the start or end of a control
block.  That will screw up automagic indenting tools.  So, never do
something like this:

<blockquote>
<pre>
#ifdef FOO
    if (foo_func(x))
#else
    if (normal_func(x))
#endif
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Instead, if you really need to do this, use:

<blockquote>
<pre>
    if (
#ifdef FOO
        foo_test(x)
#else
        normal_test(x)
#endif
        )
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Avoid sprinkling your code with <code>#ifdef</code>s.  Instead, use an
abstraction for the functionality you wish to conditionally use.  For
example, instead of having the above code fragment sprikled thorughout
a source file, use the following:


<blockquote>
<pre>
#ifdef FOO
#define TEST(x) foo_test(x)
#else
#define TEST(x) normal_test(x)
#endif

...

    if (TEST(x))
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Under Win32, <code>_WIN32</code> is always defined by the compiler.
Test for that rather than <code>WIN32</code>.

<p>
The pismere source tree use <code>NODEBUG</code> in Makefiles to check
whether we are building debug or not.  If <code>NODEBUG</code> is set,
we are building release binaries.  If <code>NODEBUG</code> is not set,
we are building debug binaries.  When debug binaries are built, our
Makefiles define <code>_DEBUG</code>.  For release, we define
<code>NDEBUG</code>.  Only check for <code>_DEBUG</code>.  We do this
to resemble the Platform SDK definitions.

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<hr>
<a name="comments">
<h2>Commenting Your Work</h2>
</a>

<p>
Each C source and header file should begin with an MIT copyright
statement, a comment describing what the file does.  MIT copyright
statements may be omitted for source code which is not distributed
outside of MIT.

<!--
The preferred convention for comments is

	/* comment text */

for one line comments, and

	/* comment text line 1
	 * comment text line 2
	 */

for multi-line comments.  (To make "M-q" in Emacs leave the closing
"*/" on a line by itself, set the variable c-hanging-comment-ender-p
to nil.) As recommended in the Gnu coding standards, your comments
should normally be complete, capitalized sentences ending with a
period.
-->

<p>
Every program should start with a comment saying briefly what it is
for.  Example: <em>fmt - filter for simple filling of text</em>.

<p>
Please write the comments in a program in English, because English
is the one language that nearly all programmers in all countries can
read.  If you do not write English well, please write comments in
English as well as you can, then ask other people to help rewrite
them.  If you can't write comments in English, please find someone to
work with you and translate your comments into English.

<p>
Please put a comment on each function saying what the function does,
what sorts of arguments it gets, and what the possible values of
arguments mean and are used for.  It is not necessary to duplicate in
words the meaning of the C argument declarations, if a C type is being
used in its customary fashion.  If there is anything nonstandard about
its use (such as an argument of type <code>char *</code> which is really the
address of the second character of a string, not the first), or any
possible values that would not work the way one would expect (such as,
that strings containing newlines are not guaranteed to work), be sure
to say so.

<p>
Also explain the significance of the return value, if there is one.

<p>
Please put two spaces after the end of a sentence in your comments, so
that the Emacs sentence commands will work.  Also, please write
complete sentences and capitalize the first word.  If a lower-case
identifier comes at the beginning of a sentence, don't capitalize it!
Changing the spelling makes it a different identifier.  If you don't
like starting a sentence with a lower case letter, write the sentence
differently (e.g., "The identifier lower-case is ...").

<p>
The comment on a function is much clearer if you use the argument
names to speak about the argument values.  The variable name itself
should be lower case, but write it in upper case when you are speaking
about the value rather than the variable itself.  Thus, "the inode
number NODE_NUM" rather than "an inode".

<p>
Here is a simple example:

<blockquote>
<pre>
/*
 *  concat
 *
 *    Concatenates two strings and returns a pointer to the new string.
 *
 *  Parameters:
 *
 *    s1 - Pointer to a null-terminated string.
 *
 *    s2 - Pointer to a null-terminated string.
 *
 *  Returns:
 *
 *    A new null-terminated string that consists of the first string 
 *    followed by the second string.  If both s1 and s2 are null, null
 *    is returned.  If only one of them is null (or an empty string), the 
 *    returned string only contains the non-null string.
 *
 *  Remarks:
 *
 *    Use free_string to free the returned string.
 *
 *  Implementation:
 *
 *    We use a clever algorithm where...
 *
 */
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Another big-block style you can use is
<blockquote>
<pre>
/******************************************************************************
 *
 *  concat
 *
 *  ...
 *
 *****************************************************************************/
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Try to avoid in-function comments, explaining things up-front when
appropriate.  Do put comments inline when things may be tricky.

<p>
There should be a comment on each static variable as well, like this:

<blockquote>
<pre>
/* Nonzero means truncate lines in the display;
   zero means continue them.  */
int truncate_lines;
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Every <code>#endif</code> should have a comment, except in the case of
short conditionals (just a few lines) that are not nested.  The
comment should state the condition of the conditional that is ending,
<strong>including its sense</strong>.  <code>#else</code> should have
a comment describing the condition <strong>and sense</strong> of the
code that follows.  For example:

<blockquote>
<pre>
#ifdef FOO
  ...
#else /* !FOO */
  ...
#endif /* !FOO */
#ifdef FOO
  ...
#endif /* FOO */
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>but, by contrast, write the comments this way for a <code>#ifndef</code>:

<blockquote>
<pre>
#ifndef FOO
  ...
#else /* FOO */
  ...
#endif /* FOO */
#ifndef FOO
  ...
#endif /* !FOO */
</pre>
</blockquote>

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<hr>
<a name="syntax">
<h2>Clean Use of C Constructs</h2>
</a>

<p>
   Please explicitly declare all arguments to functions.  Don't omit
them just because they are <code>int</code>s.

<p>
   Declarations of external functions and functions to appear later in
the source file should all go in one place near the beginning of the
file (somewhere before the first function definition in the file), or
else should go in a header file.  Don't put <code>extern</code>
declarations inside functions.

<p>
   It used to be common practice to use the same local variables (with
names like <code>tem</code>) over and over for different values within one
function.  Instead of doing this, it is better declare a separate local
variable for each distinct purpose, and give it a name which is
meaningful.  This not only makes programs easier to understand, it also
facilitates optimization by good compilers.  You can also move the
declaration of each local variable into the smallest scope that includes
all its uses.  This makes the program even cleaner.

<p>
   Don't use local variables or parameters that shadow global
identifiers.

<p>
Don't declare multiple variables in one declaration that spans lines.
Start a new declaration on each line, instead.  Only declare one
variable per line.  For example, instead of:

<blockquote>
<pre>
int    foo,
       bar;
</pre>
</blockquote>

or this:

<blockquote>
<pre>
int foo, bar;
</pre>
</blockquote>

write this:

<blockquote>
<pre>
int foo;
int bar;
</pre>
</blockquote>

(If they are global variables, each should have a comment preceding it
anyway.)

<p>
When you have an <code>if-else</code> statement nested in another
<code>if</code> statement, always put braces around the
<code>if-else</code>.  Thus, never write like this:

<blockquote>
<pre>
    if (foo)
        if (bar)
            win();
        else
            lose();
</pre>
</blockquote>

always like this:

<blockquote>
<pre>
    if (foo)
    {
        if (bar)
	{
            win();
	} else {
           lose();
	}
    }
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
If you have an <code>if</code> statement nested inside of an
<code>else</code> statement, either write <code>else if</code> on one
line, like this,

<blockquote>
<pre>
    if (foo)
    {
        ...
    }
    else if (bar)
    {
        ...
</pre>
</blockquote>

with its <code>then</code>-part indented like the preceding
<code>then</code>-part, or write the nested <code>if</code> within
braces like this:

<blockquote>
<pre>
    if (foo)
    {
        ...
    } else {
        if (bar)
            ...
    }
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
   Don't declare both a structure tag and variables or typedefs in the
same declaration.  Instead, declare the structure tag separately and
then use it to declare the variables or typedefs.

<p>
   Try to avoid assignments inside <code>if</code>-conditions.  For
example, don't write this:

<blockquote>
<pre>
    if ((foo = (char *) malloc(sizeof *foo)) == 0)
        fatal("virtual memory exhausted");
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
instead, write this:

<blockquote>
<pre>
    foo = (char *) malloc(sizeof *foo);
    if (foo == 0)
        fatal("virtual memory exhausted");
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
This makes the program easier to debug in a debugger.

<p>
When using a <code>switch</code> statement:

<blockquote>
<pre>
    switch(foo) {
    case A:
    {
	...
	break;
    }
    case B:
    {
	...
	break;
    }
    default:
    {
	...
    } 
    } /* swtich */
</pre>
</blockquote>


<p>
Don't make the program ugly to placate <code>lint</code>.  Please
don't insert any casts to <code>void</code>.  Zero without a cast is
perfectly fine as a null pointer constant, except when calling a
varargs function.

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<a name="names">
<h2>Naming Variables and Functions</h2>
</a>

<p>
   The names of global variables and functions in a program serve as
comments of a sort.  So don't choose terse names -- instead, look for
names that give useful information about the meaning of the variable or
function.  In a program, names should be English, like other
comments.

<p>
   Local variable names can be shorter, because they are used only
within one context, where (presumably) comments explain their purpose.

<p>
   Please use underscores to separate words in a name, so that the
Emacs word commands can be useful within them.  Stick to lower case;
reserve upper case for macros and <code>enum</code> constants, and for
name-prefixes that follow a uniform convention.

<p>
   For example, you should use names like
<code>ignore_space_change_flag</code>; don't use names like
<code>iCantReadThis</code>.

<p>
Actually, in mixed case names are not so bad.  However, <strong>never use
names with multiple capital letters together</strong>.

<p>
For example, never use something like <code>DCEIsAGoodAcronym</code>.
Rather, use something like <code>dce_is_a_good_acronym</code> or
<code>DceIsGoodAcronym</code>.  (In fact, you probably want something
less verbose in the first place.)

<p>
   Variables that indicate whether command-line options have been
specified should be named according the meaning of the option, not
after the option-letter.  A comment should state both the exact
meaning of the option and its letter.  For example,

<blockquote>
<pre>
/* Ignore changes in horizontal whitespace (-b).  */
int ignore_space_change_flag;
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
   When you want to define names with constant integer values, use
<code>enum</code> rather than <code>#define</code>.  This makes
debugging easier.

<p>
   Use filenames that will go over to UNIX easily.  Remember that

<h2>Software engineering practices</h2>
</a>

<p>
The following software engineering practices are strongly encouraged:

<ul>

<li>Restricting the operations which can access a given type of
data object, and grouping them together.

<li>Documenting data invariants (i.e. conditions on the
representations of data objects which are assumed to always be true)
and the meaning of data representations.

<li>Documenting non-obvious requirements and effects of procedures.

<li>Use of prototypes for all functions.

<li>Automated testing of both program components ("unit testing") and
whole programs ("integration testing").

</ul>

<p>
The following software engineering practices are discouraged:

<ul>

<li>Use of global variables.  Remember that the complexity of any
function's interface is increased by the global variables it uses,
even if that doesn't show up in the function prototype.  Global
variables are marginally acceptable to represent configuration
parameters determined by command-line arguments or a configuration
file, but even then it is preferable to find an alternative.

<!--
<li>Use of global process state.  You should avoid using alarm(), and
you should avoid using getuid() or getenv() inside libraries or other
"deep" interfaces.  Code that uses global process state tends to
interact poorly with other code in large programs.
-->

</ul>

<a name="namespaces">
<h2>Symbol namespaces</h2>
</a>

<p>
If you are writing a library, you should pick a prefix for your
library.  You should ensure that all symbols which interact with the
application's namespace (both at link time and on inclusion of the
header file) begin with your prefix (or the all-caps form of your
prefix, in the case of preprocessor symbols and enumeration constants)
followed by an underscore.  Symbols which are not intended for use by
the application should begin with your prefix followed by two
underscores.

<p>
For instance, if your prefix is "hes", then functions exported to the
user should begin with "hes_" (e.g. "hes_resolve").  Functions used
internally by the library should begin with "hes__"
(e.g. "hes__resolve" for the internal resolver function).
Preprocessor symbols intended for use by the application should begin
with "HES_" (e.g. "HES_ER_OK"); preprocessor symbols not intended for
use by the application should begin with "HES__" (e.g.
"HES__HESIOD_H", used to protect hesiod.h from multiple
inclusion).

<p>
Names of structures should begin with your prefix, but structure
fields don't need to.  Strictly speaking, structure fields interact
with the user's namespace because the user might have "#define"'d them
to something before including your header file, but applications
generally shouldn't be "#define"ing lots of lowercase symbols, so this
is not a real worry.

<a name="strings">
<h2>Strings</h2>
</a>

<p>
Here are a few guidelines you should follow:

<ol>
<p>
<li>
In general, a function should dynamically allocate strings rather than
having fixed arbitrary sizes for strings.  This applies to buffers
used inside a function, buffers passed into a function (i.e., the
function should have a buffer size argument), and buffers returned by
a function (i.e., the function allocates the buffer and the caller
calls a function to free the buffer after the buffer is no longer
needed).
<p>
<li>
If a function is using fixed-size buffers, the function must check
that it does not write past the end of the buffer no matter what the
caller feeds the function.  This can be done by using the "n" versions
of the string handling routines and keeping track of buffer sizes when
doing string operations.  Failing to do so can result in unexpected
crashes and even security holes.
</ol>

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<hr>
<a name="cleanup">
<h2>Errors & Cleanup</h2>
</a>


<p>
A function will need to cleanup resources that it uses internally.
However, a function must still be easy.  It is not acceptable for a
function's "normal" code path to be a sequence of nested if's that
check for errors.  Neither is it acceptable to embed resource cleanup
at every point where an error might occur.

<p>
Rather, a function should initialize all resource variables to a known
initial state and clean up all allocated resources in a single
location.  Critical errors should cause the function to execute this
single block of cleanup code.  The cleanup code will have a
<code>cleanup:</code> label.  On an error, the main function body
should set an error flag and go to the label (i.e., <code>goto
cleanup:</code>).

<p>
To properly be able to do this, the function must initialize all
resources and error variables that may need to be checked or cleaned
up on returning from the function.  Here is an example:

<blockquote>
<pre>
int
check_dir_file(
    char* dir,
    char* file
    )
{
    int result = 0;
    char* buffer = 0;

    buffer = malloc(strlen(first) + strlen(file) + sizeof(MY_PATH_SEPARATOR));
    if (!buffer)
    {
        result = MY_ERROR_NO_MEMORY;
        goto cleanup;
    }
    /*
     * We know that first and file won't be changing lengths, so we can
     * safely write into the buffer w/o checking sizes.  We choose to use
     * strcat() to the start of the buffer each time because we prefer to
     * sacrifice a little speed to have the code a little more readable.
     * 
     */
    buffer[0] = 0;
    strcat(buffer, dir);
    strcat(buffer, MY_PATH_SEPARATOR);
    strcat(buffer, file);
    result = check_filepath(buffer);

  cleanup:
    if (buffer)
        free(buffer);
    return result;
}
</pre>

<a name="portability_3rd">
<h2>Portability considerations for code we get from third parties</h2>
</a>

<p>
The overriding principle for code obtained from third parties is to
make as few changes as possible.  A lot of third-party code has a very
bad approach to portability, or cares about a lot of platforms we
don't care about.  You should attempt to follow the portability
approach used by the rest of the program, such as it may be.  Ideally,
any changes you make should be made in such a manner that they can be
incorporated into the source tree maintained by the third party.
