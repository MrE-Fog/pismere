Wed Feb 1 12:00:00 1995  John Rivlin  <jrivlin@cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.in: Create install-windows target

Tue Nov 22 10:53:16 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@sanguine.cygnus.com>

	* random_key.c (des_random_key): Don't assume that the argument is
	aligned on an integer boundary.

Mon Oct 31 19:40:21 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@sanguine.cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.in (CODE): Remove Imakefile.

Fri Oct 28 15:21:01 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@sanguine.cygnus.com>

	* read_password.c (old_sigfunc): Use sigtype in declaration,
	rather than guessing based on POSIX define.

Mon Oct 10 19:18:48 1994  Julia Menapace  (jcm at toad.com)

	* mac_time.c:  Include des.h and AddressXlation.h.  Put
	gettimeofdaynet wrapper on gettimeofday_no_offset so it can be
	returned as a DES pointer with the expected calling sequence.

	* new_rnd_key.c: Make forward declarations and function
	definitions match the function prototypes that were added as
	new external declarations to des.h: des_set_sequence_number, 
	des_generate_random_block, des_new_random_key,
	des_init_random_number_generator. des_set_random_generator_seed

	(des_init_random_number_generator): Changes to port routine
	to the Mac.  Initialize	the seed using RANDOM_KRB_INT32_1
	and RANDOM_KRB_INT32_2 instead of gethostid and getpid.  Use a
	KRB_INT32 instead of a timeval and set it using TIME_GMT_UNIXSEC
	instead of gettimeofday.

Tue Aug 9 12:00:00 John Rivlin (jrivlin@fusion.com)

	* win_time.c: Removed copy of time structure as stack
	is now set up properly.

	* Makefile.In: Broke up clean target to not do useless
	deletes on unix.

Mon Aug 29 10:12:42 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin@perdiem)

	* key_sched.c (des_key_sched): even if we return an error, build
	the key schedule anyway. This helps with testing, and avoids
	garbage encryptions in cases where the error isn't checked.

Fri Jul 29 17:18:55 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

	* random_key.c (des_random_key): use KRB_INT32 for half-key
	manipulation, so the upper half really gets set.

Tue Jul 19 20:06:14 1994  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com)

	* random_key.c (des_random_key): Don't initialize static local
	variable n.  Fiddled with whitespace in srandom call.

Fri Jul 15 17:35:30 1994  John Rivlin (jrivlin@fusion.com)

	* ren.msg: updated to handle all files (changelogs, makefiles etc)

	* Makefile.in: added "-" on clean: to avoid stupid messages

Fri Jul 8 02:40:54 1994  John Rivlin  (jrivlin@fusion.com)

	* makefile.in: Updated file with portable directory syntax for PC.
	Changed .o and .a references to portable syntax
	Removed all response files which needed to be generated under unix
	to simplify configure process so that it may be run on the PC.
	Placed objects in .lib file so that DLL construction can take place
	without a response file.  This solves a problem with running out of
	memory on the PC during builds.
	Updated clean: target to place rm commands on seperate lines for
	compatibility with PC DEL command.

Tue Jul  5 11:31:59 1994  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com)

	* string_to_key.c (des_string_to_key): Deleted static and (some)
	register decls.
	* quad_cksum.c (four_bytes_vax_to_nets): Ditto.
	* util.c (des_cblock_print_file): Ditto.

	* weak_key.c (weak): Now const.
	(des_is_weak_key): Compensate.

Fri Jul  1 03:12:31 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	Make Kerberos build using Think C on Macintosh.

	* mac_time.c:  Use GetDateTime, not time.
	* quad_cksum.c:  Avoid using printf().
	* %DesLib-project:  New Think C project file for building
	the DES library as an ordinary library.  (Unfortunately this
	is a binary file -- there are no textual makefiles in Think C).
	This makes it semi-possible to debug the code.
	* %DesLib-project-A4:  Ditto, for building as a library to go
	into a device driver.

Thu Jun 30 23:11:11 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@tweedledumb.cygnus.com)

	* *.c:  Remove remaining RCS ID strings.  Strings used as `char *'
	initializers upset Think C when building device drivers, since it
	doesn't have a good way to relocate the pointers when the driver
	is loaded.

	* f_parity.c:  Clarify public domain ownership.

	* *.c:  Use #include "..." rather than #include <...> for
	our own local include files, because Think C can't find them
	when enclosed in <...>.

Wed Jun 22 18:29:48 1994  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com)

	* new_rnd_key.c, string_to_key.c: Include <string.h>.

Sat Jun 18 09:05:30 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	Make DES library independent of krb library again.

	* Makefile.in (SRCS, OBJS):  Use DES_TIME_SRCS and DES_TIME_OBJS.
	* unix_time.c, mac_time.c, win_time.c:  New files implement
	TIME_GMT_UNIXSEC for the various hosts.  Code moved from *_glue.c
	in lib/krb.

Fri Jun 17 05:01:03 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (DESSRCS):  Move read_password.c to SERVER_DES_SRCS,
	since we don't use it on micro clients.  Clarify comments.
	(Links of test routines):  Add $(LDFLAGS) to the line so that
	mac-mf.sed can find these and modify them to run "Link".

Thu Jun 16 17:08:58 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (unixmac):  New target.

	* f_tables.h:  Add comments on the DEB macro.
	* new_rnd_key.c:  Remove RCS crud, update export notice.

	Use TIME_GMT_UNIXSEC_US rather than gettimeofday.  Use
	RANDOM_KRB_INT32_1 and RANDOM_KRB_INT32_2 rather than
	getpid() and gethostid().  Remove RCS crud, update export notice.
	* string_to_key.c (des_string_to_key):  Int functions return results.
	* testit.c:  Print usage message if no args.
	* verify.c, testit.c: Declare des_debug extern, not common.

Wed Jun  8 13:09:14 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (DBG):  Move to where it will actually work.
	* testit.c, verify.c:  Include <krb.h>.  Remove raw extern
	declarations.  Pull RCS crud.
	* verify.c:  In Windows, set screen buffer to keep all output.

	* string_to_key.c (des_string_to_key):  Fix argument type to match
	correct prototype.  Pull RCS crud.

Fri May 27 16:55:33 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (DBG):  Override with library-building flags.

	* des_internal.h:  Include krb.h when compiling the DES
	routines, since it describes some of the DES routines when
	documenting the external interface of Kerberos.
	* f_cbc.c, f_ecb.c, f_parity.c, f_pcbc.c, key_sched.c,
	quad_cksum.c, string_to_key.c, weak_key.c:  Add INTERFACE to
	definitions of functions visible in the programmer interface.
	* string_to_key.c:  Remove some error printf's for environments
	that don't have printf; put them under #ifdef DEBUG.

Tue May 24 06:10:57 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* enc.c: Pull RCS crud.
	* f_pcbc.c (des_pcbc_encryption):  Lint ivec.
	* key_test.c:  Toss the ridiculous doubled IBMPC/BSDUNIX printf's,
	use a simple portable printf.  Typo in msg.  Pull RCS crud.
	* new_rnd_key.c, quad_cksum.c, string_to_key.c:  Lint.
	* quad_cksum.c:  Pull RCS crud.

Sat May 21 03:37:01 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	Microsoft Windows port.

	* Makefile.in (c-libdes.${LIBEXT)):  Typo; and fix .o to .obj.
	* des_internal.h:  Remove pre-Fergusen stuff, leaving one #define.
	* f_tables.h (FF_UINT32):  Add this, which makes a KRB_UINT32 out
	of a constant that might otherwise only be int or less.
	* f_cbc.c, f_cksum.c, f_pcbc.c:  Use it.  Line up code neatly.
	* key_sched.c:  Lint, pull RCS crud.
	* ren.msg:  Insert column of entries for MIT PC release.

Thu May 19 22:18:24 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* ren.msg, Makefile.in:  Remove references to remnants.

	* Makefile.in (OTHERSRCS, OTHEROBJS):  Rename to FERG_* for clarity.

	(####):  Move host-configuration insertion point so that the
	per-host Makefile fragments can override the above.
	(LIBEXT):  Use it everywhere rather than ".a".
	(libdes.$(LIBEXT)):  Avoid making a .bak file.  Add and 
	use $(ARCHIVEARGS) to allow making the incredible MSC LIB
	command work.
	(c-libdes.$(LIBEXT)):  Add rule to build control file for MSC LIB.
	This rule must run on Unix (FIXME) since it uses sed and tr.  I
	didn't know the equivalent DOS commands...
	
	* f_tables.h (DES_IP_RIGHT_BITS, DES_FP_RIGHT_BITS): Insert a cast
	to unsigned, to circumvent a bug in the Macintosh MPW 3.2 C
	compiler which loses the unsignedness and then does an arithmetic
	shift rather than a logical shift.
	(DEB):  Add debug macro for very nested macro defns.
	(DES_DO_ENCRYPT):  Insert DEB calls to make it possible to
	debug when DES fails.

Fri May 13 01:59:09 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  Change {} to () for Microsoft NMAKE.
	* Makefile:  Remove remnant of old config scheme.
	* ren.msg:  Specify short and long names for DOS file systems.
	* key_test.c, quad_cksum.c, testit.c, verify.c:  Pull unused
	errmsg, errno.

	* Makefile.in:  Don't build verify, key_test, and testit every
	time we build the library.

	make_key_sched.c, make_odd.c, make_p.c, make_p_table.c, make_s.c,
	make_s_table.c, misc.c, noop.c, pcbc_encrypt.c, s_table.h.ibm,
	tables.h:  Remove remnants of non-Fergusen DES code.  These are all
	unused, have long, non-DOSlike names, and confuse people (me
	anyway) into thining that they're live code.

Fri May  6 02:04:48 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* desglue.c (quad_cksum):  Put argument declarations in order.

	KRB_INT32 instead of long for 4-byte type.

	* f_tables.c: Include des.h.

	* string_to_key.c (des_string_to_key): Mask values to 32 bits
	before printing.

	* testit.c (nflag): Set to 1; running 1000 identical iterations
	was silly.

	* verify.c (print8): New routine.
	(main): Clean up output formatting.

Thu Feb 11 13:05:12 1993  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@cambridge.cygnus.com)

	mangling as it interferes with debugging.

Tue Nov  8 12:12:32 1988  William Sommerfeld  (wesommer at binkley)

	* (util) Remove \ before { and } characters (causes RT 
	compiler warning)

	* (read_password) Print a newline after saying "try again".

	* (read_password) Merge in changes by Jim Bloom to do a clearerr
	after a read fails, and protect against an RTM attack by
	changing gets to fgets.

Fri Sep 16 16:26:55 1988  Bill Sommerfeld  (wesommer at ra)

	* (read_password) fix dependancies for BSDUNIX.

	* (*) debug->des_debug

	* (*) debug_print() -> des_debug_print()

	* (Makefile) add dbg_prt.o to list of files included in build.

	* (des.c) remove debug_print; it's in dbg_prt.c

        * (des_internal.h) contains definitions of AUTH_DES_ITER, 
	s-box structures, which aren't part of the encryption interface.

	* (*) cbc_encrypt() -> des_cbc_encrypt()

	* (*) cbc_cksum() -> des_cbc_cksum()

	* (quad_cksum.c) make {four,two}_bytes_vax_to_nets be static to
	avoid namespace pollution.
