Winsock Helper API Version 2.0 (release 2.0.0.5)
Released on 11/24/98

Compiling:
---------
Using MSVC++ 1.52c or greater, just type nmake in this directory and
it will give you further instructions.

To select between a debug versus release build, use DEBUG=0 or DEBUG=1
at the name command-line.

Example: nmake win32 DEBUG=1


Editing the 16-bit project:
--------------------------
If you edit the MSVC++ 1.52c projects, run them through the fixmak15.pl
Perl script.

For example:
perl ..\fixmak15.pl < wshelper.mak > w.mak
(and then copy w.mak over wshelper.mak once you verify w.mak is ok.)


Dependencies for the 16-bit project:
-----------------------------------
The fixmak15.pl-processed makefile does not have header file and other
indirect dependencies.  So you may find yourself doing a nmake /a win16
to rebuid Win16 targets in cases where you change header files.


Large DNS packet size hack:
--------------------------

There is a hack in the code to handle illegally large (>512 bytes) DNS
replies.  It lives in wshelper/resolve.c and is controlled by:

#define USE_PACKETSZ_HACK

If you do not wish to support illegally large DNS replies, just undefine
the symbol above.
