<h2>The Build Script</h2>

<p>
The tree uses the Pismere build script, <code>build.pl</code>.  This
script is known to work with ActivePerl builds 517 and 522 (<a
href="http://www.activestate.com/"</a>www.activestate.com</a>).  Older
builds of ActivePerl had subtle incompatibility problems.  Newer
builds probably work...try them at your own risk.
</p>

<p>
The build works under Windows NT.  It should work under Windows 95,
but we do not test it regularly under that OS.  You should use the
default command-line shell for those OSes, or something fairly
compatible.
</p>


<a name="running">
<h2>Running the Build</h2>
</a>

<p>
Go to the directory you want to build and invoke the build script.
The invocation will vary depending on how your system is set up.  Here
are the most common ways to build:
</p>

<ul>

<li><code>build.pl -?</code> - show usage information.

<li><code>build.pl --docs</code> - show this documentation.

<li><code>build.pl</code> (or <code>build.pl all</code>)- builds debug target.

<li><code>build.pl NODEBUG=1</code> (or <code>build.pl all NODEBUG=1</code>)
- builds release target.

<li><code>build.pl clean</code> - cleans debug target.

<li><code>build.pl clean NODEBUG=1</code> - cleans release target.

</ul>

<p>
You may need to put <code>perl</code> at the start of each of the
above commands, depending on whether your shell knows how to execute a
<code>.pl</code> file.
</p>

<p>


<h2>Using the Build Script to Build Your Code</h2>

<p>
The build script works by entering a directory, and looking for a
<code>Makefile.src</code>, a <code>Makefile.dir</code>, or a
<code>Makefile</code> file.

<p>
If the <code>Makefile.src</code> is present, the script will try to
create the target defined by this file.  Therefore, only one target
can be created per directory.  The target cannot consist of source
files from other directories.  If this is necessary, you should first
build the other directory, creating a library, and then include that
library as part of the target you're trying to build.  If you need to
create multiple targets from a set of source files, you can simply
create additional directories that link in the object or library files
created by the sources.

<p>
If the <code>Makefile.dir</code> is present, the script will try to
build the directories indicated in this file.  The directories can be
build before and/or after the current directory.

<p>
If neither of the above files exist, the script will simply
invoke the make utility on <code>Makefile</code>.

<h3>Adding a component to the build</h3>

<p>First, go to the directory where the component is located.  Then,
create a <code>Makefile.src</code> as described <a
href="#Makefile.src">below</a>.

<p>
You will then be able to run <code>build.pl</code> in a variety of
ways to get the most common types of builds.  See <a
href="#running">Running the Build</a> above for information on how to
run <code>build.pl</code>.
</p>

<h3>Adding a subdirectory to the build</h3>

<p>
If you need to build subdirectories, create a
<code>Makefile.dir</code> in the directory.  At least one of these
variables must be defined in <code>Makefile.dir</code>.

<dl>

<dt><code><b>PREDIRS</b></code><dd> List of directories to build
before building the current directory.

<dt><code><b>DIRS</b></code><dd> List of directories to build after
building the current directory.

<dt><code><b>OPTDIRS</b></code><dd> List of optional directories to
build after building the current directory.  (These directories will
only be built if at least one of <code>dirname/Makefile.src</code>,
<code>dirname/Makefile.dir</code>, or <code>dirname/Makefile</code>
exists).

</dl>

<h4>Example</h4>

<pre>
DIRS=dir_1 dir_2
</pre>

Where <code>dir_n</code> is the name of the subdirectory you want to
build.  The build will first build the current directory then the
subdirectories.


<h2>Build Options Reference</h2>

<p>
Below are the options that control the build.  These are in addition
to any flags shown when you do a <code>build.pl -?</code>.

<h3>Common Global Build environment options</h3>

<p>
These are some of the common options you may want to use in building.
You can set any option at the <code>build.pl</code> command-line.  The
default build is a debug build.  
</p>

<dl>

<dt><code><b>NODEBUG</b></code><dd> Set to 1 to build an optimized
version of your app with no debug info (i.e., a release build).

<dt><code><b>VENDORMOD</b></code><dd> Set to the organization making a
modification to the sources.  This helps figure out who made this
modified build.

</dl>

<h3>Uncommon Global Build environment options</h3>

<p>
You should not have to play with the settings in this section.  They
are here for completeness.
</p>


<dl>

<dt><code><b>APPVER</b></code><dd> [ 4.0 | 5.0 ] - For build time
checking for OS version dependencies and to mark the executable with
OS version information.  (Default is 4.0.) [<i>not much reason to use
this</i>]

<dt><code><b>TARGETOS</b></code><dd> [ WIN95 | WINNT | BOTH ] - For
some build time checking for platform dependencies.  (Default is
WINNT.)  [<i>not much reason to use this</i>]

<dt><code><b>TARGETLANG</b></code><dd> [ LANG_JAPANESE | LANG_CHINESE
| LANG_KOREAN ] - For compile & link flags for building applications
to run on Far-East Windows. (This is an optional parameter.  The
system locale is the default.)  [<i>not much reason to use this</i>]

<dt><code><b>_WIN32_IE</b></code><dd> [ 0x0300 | 0x0400 ] - For
compile and link flags for building applications and components to run
on Internet Explorer. (This is an optional parameter.  IE 4.0 is the
default.)  [<i>not much reason to use this</i>]

<dt><code><b>NO_DEBUG_CRT</b></code><dd> Set to 1 to <b>not</b> use
the debug version of the CRT when building a debug application.

<dt><code><b>TUNE</b></code><dd> Set to 1 to get working set tuner
info.

<dt><code><b>PROFILE</b></code><dd> Set to 1 to get call attributed
profiling info.

<p><em>Note:</em> <code>NODEBUG</code>, <code>TUNE</code>, and
<code>PROFILE</code> are mutually exclusive.

</dl>

<a name="Makefile.src">
<h3>Makefile.src options</h3>
</a>

<p>
At this point, $(O) is the output directory.  NODEBUG will indicate
whether you're doing a release or debug build.  STD_LIBS consists of
standard Win32 libraries.
</p>

<h4>Required</h4>

<dl>

<dt><code><b>NAME</b></code><dd> Base name of target (no extension).

<dt><code><b>TARGETTYPE</b></code><dd> [ EXE | DLL | LIB | NONE ] -
Type of target.  <em>Note:</em> When the target type is NONE, it is
not necessary (or even desirable) to define <code>NAME</code>,
<code>TARGETSS</code>, or <code>OBJS</code>.  NONE is very useful as a
means to use <code>PLACE</code> when not doing any kind of build at
all, when building files that the build does not yet support (e.g.,
help files), or when trying to integrate with a package with its own
separate build.

<dt><code><b>TARGETSS</b></code><dd> [ console | windows ] - Target
subsystem.

<dt><code><b>OBJS</b></code><dd> List of object files (i.e.,
$(O)\foo.obj).

</dl>

<h4>Optional</h4>

<dl>

<dt><code><b>DEF_FILE</b></code><dd> Name of .def file, if any.

<dt><code><b>RES</b></code><dd> Name of resource file, if any (i.e.,
$(O)\foo.res).

<p>

<dt><code><b>PLACE</b></code><dd> List of additional files to place.

<dt><code><b>NO_PLACE</b></code><dd> If defined, will not try to place
output files.

<dt><code><b>NO_EXTERNAL_DEPS</b></code><dd> If defined, will not use
$(NAME).dep as a dependency file (overrides USE_EXTERNAL_DEPS).  The
default is to silently try to use a $(NAME).dep file.

<dt><code><b>USE_EXTERNAL_DEPS</b></code><dd> If defined, will give
warning if $(NAME).dep is not present.  The default is to silently try
to use a $(NAME).dep file.

<p>

<dt><code><b>INCLUDES</b></code><dd> List of include dirs,
<code>;</code>-delimtited (e.g.,
<code>INCLUDES=..\include;..\foo\inc;"..\annoying path with
spaces\inc"</code>).

<dt><code><b>LIB_PATHS</b></code><dd> List of lib dirs, ;-delimited
(e.g., <code>LIB_PATHS=..\lib;..\foo\lib</code>).

<dt><code><b>LIBS</b></code><dd> Libraries to use (e.g.,
<code>LIBS=foo.lib bar.lib ..\baz\$(O)\baz.lib</code> or
<code>LIBS=$(STD_LIBS)</code>).

<dt><code><b>DEP_LIBS</b></code><dd> Anything that the output file
depends on.  This is not used for linking, but it is used to determine
whether the file to be linked is out of date.  It may be useful to
include this variable in the <code>LIBS</code> line too.  (e.g.,
<code>LIBS=subcomponent/a.lib ../other/component.lib</code>).

<dt><code><b>USE_DEFAULTLIB</b></code><dd> If defined, will use default
libraries (the default is to only use the libraries specified in
<code>LIBS</code>).

<p>

<dt><code><b>UNICODE</b></code><dd>Define this to use unicode libraries
and entry points.

<p>

<dt><code><b>USE_MFC</b></code><dd> Use MFC (DLL by default).

<dt><code><b>USE_MFC_STATIC</b></code><dd> Use static MFC.

<p>

<dt><code><b>USE_LIBC_STD</b></code><dd> Use static libc (not thread-safe).

<dt><code><b>USE_LIBC_MT</b></code><dd> Use thread-safe satic libc.

<dt><code><b>USE_LIBC_DLL</b></code><dd> Use thread-safe libc DLL (default)

<dt><code><b>NO_LIBC</b></code><dd> Do not use any libc.

<dt><code><b>NO_LIBC_LINK</b></code><dd> Do not explicitly specify the
libc on the linker line.  This is needed if you need to override stuff
in libc (like operator new).  (NOTE: Perhaps this should be the
default.)

<p>

<dt><code><b>USE_PCH</b></code><dd> Define to use automatic
pre-compiled headers (which will be in $(NAME).pch).

<dt><code><b>USE_MINIMAL</b></code><dd> Define for minimal rebuilds
(-Gm).  This setting is ignored in a release build.  <em>Note:</em>
Minimal rebuild relies on class definitions not changing between
include files. Class definitions must be global for a project (there
should be only one definition of a given class), because the
dependency information in the .IDB file is created for the entire
project. If you have more than one definition for a class in your
project, disable minimal rebuild.

<dt><code><b>NO_MINIMAL</b></code><dd> Define to not do a minimal
rebuild (overrides <code>USE_MINIMAL</code>).

<dt><code><b>USE_CPP_RTTI</b></code><dd> Define to get C++ run-time
type information (-GR).

<dt><code><b>USE_CPP_EH</b></code><dd> Define to get C++ exception
handling (-GX).

<dt><code><b>PCH_FILE</b></code><dd> Set to header file to use for
pre-compiled header (implies <code>USE_PCH</code>).  Note that this
option is not needed if you want the compiler to automatically handle
pre-compiled headers.  It's only needed if you need to control how
pre-compiled headers are handled.

<dt><code><b>GEN_BSC</b></code><dd> Define for SBR/BSC creation.

<dt><code><b>NO_BSC</b></code><dd> Define for no SBR/BSC creation
(overrides <code>GEN_BSC</code>).

<dt><code><b>KEEP_SBRS</b></code><dd> Define to not truncate
.SBR files when building a .BSC file.

<p>

<dt><code><b>GEN_MAP</b></code><dd> Generates a .MAP file in the
build.

<p>

<dt><code><b>C_DEFINE</b></code><dd> Only for <code>-D</code> style
definitions to pass to the C/C++ compiler.

<dt><code><b>RC_DEFINE</b></code><dd> Only for <code>-D</code> style
definitions to pass to the resource compiler.

<dt><code><b>C_FLAGS</b></code><dd> Any additional flags to pass to
the C/C++ compiler.  You should not use this unless absolutely
necessary.  Using this may signal a need to have the build system
support more options.  If it's a <code>-D</code> definition, put it in
<code>C_DEFINE</code>.

<dt><code><b>RC_FLAGS</b></code><dd> Any additional flags to pass to
the resource compiler.  You should not use this unless absolutely
necessary.  Using this may signal a need to have the build system
support more options.  If it's a <code>-D</code> definition, put it in
<code>RC_DEFINE</code>.

<p>

<dt><code><b>USE_SUFFIX_CP</b></code><dd> Define this to allow
<code>.cp</code> files to be treated as C++ source files.
